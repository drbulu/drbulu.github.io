<p style="text-align: justify">

Dr. Bulukani Mlalazi (<b><i>drbulu</i></b>) is a research scientist (molecular biologist) and data science enthusiast with a passion for applying data science techniques to important problems so that insights from data can drive wise and effective decisions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;">
Presently, <b><i>drbulu</i></b> is a Research Associate at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers (ACEMS). The current project aims to incorporate statistical models developed at ACEMS into a data visualisation app.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;">
Previously, <b><i>drbulu</i></b> was a Research Scientist at the Centre for Tropical Crops and Biocommodities (CTCB) at (QUT) as part of a team conducting research into banana biofortification, with pro-vitamin A and iron, in collaboration with colleagues at the National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO). </p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;">
In 2010 <b><i>drbulu</i></b> completed his PhD in molecular biology at QUT, under the supervision of Distinguished Professor James Dale in research to define the role of the phytoene synthase (PSY) genes in the accumulation of pro-vitamin A carotenoids in bananas. His thesis contributed to an increased understanding of the role of this important gene family in regulating carotenoid production. Importantly, this research experience was the genesis of <b><i>drbulu</i></b>'s passion for data science and its effective application.</p>

## Programming Projects

1. [stats tutorial](https://drbulu.shinyapps.io/stats_tutorial): Web application developed using the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) web applicaiton framework for [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

2. [Machine learning](http://drbulu.github.io/machine_learning/) page. A growing work in progress that enables me to apply my skills in machine learning as they grow.

## Continual Skills Development
<p style="text-align: justify">My interest in data science and data analysis is driven by a desire to extract the maximum meaning and useful information from the data that I create and use. This, I believe, is how we can take advantage of the meaning behind the data to provide transformative solutions to challenging and important problems.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Naturally, this interest has kindled a love of programming, which is the engine of modern data analysis. Presently, I am comfortable with the R and Java programming languages. I am also familar with web programming (HTML, CSS and Javascript), SQL, Ruby and Python languages, while C++ is a language that I would like to learn.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">My main aim is to improve my programming skills in relation to data analysis. Android programming is another area of interest as I enjoy the process of mobile device development.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">One of the avenues through which I have sharpened my programming skills is through the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) platform. The courses that I have completed thus far are summarised below:</p>
